A general overview for new members, to catch up with the team's activities and practice with STM32 microcontrollers.

Hello! This (unfinished) repo will try to give you a basic introduction to STM32 programming for our team.

We recommend you to follow some tutorials over the internet, try to replicate them in your code on different projects and then flash your work on the actual boards in toolbox.

Good luck, and may the Flash Release be with you!
