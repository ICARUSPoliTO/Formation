# Formation
A general overview for new members, to catch up with the team's activities and practice with STM32 microcontrollers.

We recommend to follow some tutorials over the internet in order to replicate them in your code on different projects and then flash your work on the actual boards at Toolbox.
Start with [this](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNyfXcjhOAwO5HNTKpZPsqBhelLF2rWQx&si=JP6wjN-cqGAb2lGn) introductory playlist to STM microcontrollers.

The rest of the repo will be filled with small tutorials and notes, to follow in the following order:
(...) Insert fields.

- [Quick Introduction To Terms](introToTerms.md)
- [Coding and Commenting Guidelines](namingConventionsAndCommentingSuggestions.md)
- [Creating a Project in CubeMX](creatingAProjectInCubeMX.md)
- [Blinking LED](blinkingLED.md)
- [Uart Guide](Uart Guide/)

Good luck, and may the Flash Release be with you!
